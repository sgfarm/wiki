# wiki

This is the repo for the Solid Ground Farm Wiki. It's publicly available at [wiki.solidgroundfarm.org](https://wiki.solidgroundfarm.org/).

This repository is pretty barebones; it's just some nix files for environment and a `fly.toml` file for Fly.io.

There's no CI/CD for this repo because to deploy the service, no building happens on the developer's machine. Fly.io does all the work.
